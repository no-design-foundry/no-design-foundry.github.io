There was a typeface that was soon replaced by an algorithm, this typeface's only distinctive feature was something that soon every font can turn into.

The font is dead, long live the algorithm!

It was a long journey of slowly learning how to automate my tedious inhuman workflow to produce the variable font until completely automating it.

It already asks the question of our future lives, are we gonna be all replaced by an algorithm? What kind of work will humans do? Only the creative one? I don't know, but lets leave production of such fonts to an algorithm.
